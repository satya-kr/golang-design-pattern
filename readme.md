# Go Design Pattern

## SOLID
 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)    
 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 
 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Summary

 **Single Responsibility Principle**
 - A type should only have one reason to change  Separation of concerns
 - different types/packages handling different, independent tasks/problems

**Open-Closed Principle**
 - Types should be open for extension but closed for modification

 
**Liskov Substitution Principle**
 - You should be able to substitute an embedding type in place of its
   embedded part

**Interface Segregation Principle**
 - Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
 - YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

**Dependency Inversion Principle**

 - High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
